<p class="subheading">
<!-- <img src="asset/keith-james.jpg" class="right"> -->
<br>I am pleased to present the <?php echo quin::$name;?> results for the year ended 31 October 2014.</p>
<p class="paragraph">We made a pre-tax profit of £4.3 million (2013: £3.5 million), which represents a considerable improvement on the previous year and reflects our continuing investment in the business together with a more benign economic environment.</p>

<h3 class="title">Highlights</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Pre-tax profit has increased by 23.6%.</li>
    <li>Tier 1 capital ratio of 25.5%.</li>
    <li>Increase in loans and advances of 15%</li>
    <li>Specific credit losses of only £54,000.</li>
    <li>Increase in deposits of 8.5%.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="title">Economic Environment</h3>
<p>The early part of the year was characterised by a tangible improvement in confidence bolstered by clear evidence that the UK was in recovery mode.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Whilst growth has been maintained throughout 2014, the second half of the year and in particular the final quarter has seen concerns being raised over its sustainability.</p>

<p class="paragraph">The eurozone continues to flirt with deflation and whilst the President of the European Central Bank utters fine words, meaningful action has been conspicuously absent.</p>

<p class="paragraph">The UK and USA remain in splendid isolation as regards economic growth amongst the major nations and the worry is that the eurozone, given its relative importance as a trading partner, more so than the USA, will drag down the UK.</p>

<p class="paragraph">This uncertainty and ebbing of confidence is manifested in the current prognosis for interest rates, with no expectation of a rise in Bank of England Base Rate before the second half of 2015. The fear factor is even more pronounced when one considers longer term rates, which have descended to levels not previously seen.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Nevertheless, if the UK is able to avoid eurozone contagion and the new government of whichever hue is elected in 2015 can get to grips with the deficit without stifling enterprise, then the future looks promising.</p>



<h3 class="title">Financial Performance</h3>
<p>The profit for the year has been driven by a good all-round performance from our primary business units, coupled with an improvement in commercial and residential property prices. Interest margins have increased as evidenced by a turnaround in net interest income, which became positive again having been negative for the previous two years.</p>

<p class="paragraph">I anticipate that this margin improvement will continue into 2015 if the demand for credit remains subdued. That, combined with an extension of the Bank of England's Funding for Lending Scheme for another year, will dampen the demand from banks for retail deposits.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Our five-year summary highlights how we have shown steady progress from the depths of the financial crisis, and, if the UK economy continues its upward trajectory, there is no reason why this trend should not continue</p>


<h3 class="title">Commercial Lending</h3>

<p>Last year I highlighted the positive outlook for Commercial Lending and I am delighted to say that my optimism has been vindicated.</p>

<p class="paragraph">The division has produced a much improved performance as fee income has risen, driven by increased new business levels.</p>

<p class="paragraph">In common with other areas of our business, interest margins have improved as funding costs have reduced; credit losses have been minimal and commercial property prices have recovered some of their previous losses as confidence in the market has grown.</p>

<p class="paragraph">As the year progressed, we saw heightened levels of activity within our core markets with particular interest in our renewable energy funding proposition.</p>

<p class="paragraph">In order to meet demand, we have taken on more staff to ensure that we have the capacity to maintain our service levels to both new and existing clients.</p>

<p class="paragraph">At the year end we have a significant new business pipeline and a number of early stage opportunities, which augurs well for 2015.</p>


<h3 class="title">Hodge Lifetime</h3>
<p>Hodge Lifetime is the group's brand covering the retirement market. Our core products are pension annuities and equity release mortgages. We believe that this market offers significant growth potential, underpinned by strong demographic trends.</p>

<p class="paragraph">There is a growing trend for lending into retirement for a variety of reasons – not least because we continues to be called upon to help children onto, and up, the property ladder. It is also more common for people to enter retirement without having paid off their mortgage.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Late in 2013, we launched the Retirement Mortgage, aimed at a different market segment to our other equity release products. For those retirees that benefit from a reasonable level of pension income, a Retirement Mortgage offers a more flexible way of borrowing in retirement, with the interest on the loan being paid from pension income.</p>

<p class="paragraph">This product has been extremely well-received by the market and is starting to gain traction, particularly for older borrowers as there remains a lack of alternative mortgage products.</p>

<p class="paragraph">The Retirement Mortgage is funded by us, and we hope that this product becomes a significant source of new business during 2015.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Residential property remains the principal form of saving for the majority of retirees and it is inevitable that a growing proportion will utilise their major asset to improve their retirement prospects through equity release, especially if their pension savings can be accessed in a flexible way.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Our lifetime mortgages, where interest is rolled up until death, are amongst the most flexible plans in the market, offering the ability to repay an element of the loan capital should the customer's circumstances change, and the freedom to downsize to a smaller property and repay the loan without incurring any early repayment charges. These products highlight our commitment to innovation and serving the needs of the customer.</p>

<p class="paragraph">As at 31 October 2014 we also had £618 million of equity release mortgage assets under management including £397 million for other financial institutions.</p>

<p class="paragraph">We were pleased to be named the Best Equity Release Provider for the second year running at the 2014 Moneyfacts Investment, Life and Pensions awards. In addition, at the 2014 Equity Release Awards, we were named the Best Provider for Adviser Support, in recognition of our commitment to supporting the financial advice community in growing this market.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Hodge Life Assurance Company Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the <?php echo quin::$name;?>, specialises in matching pension annuity liabilities with the long-term fixed rate returns offered by traditional equity release loans. It had a successful year reporting a profit before tax of £6.9 million (2013: £14.5 million). While profit reduced year on year, the results for 2013 included elements of non-recurring profit, and after eliminating these effects, the Company has performed at a similar level to the previous year. This is despite the upheaval caused by the pension reforms announced by the Chancellor in his March 2014 Budget, which severely disrupted the pension annuity market for the remainder of the year.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Since that date, there has been much speculation as to how these reforms will take effect, coupled with further announcements from the Treasury as to proposed changes in the taxation of pensions and annuities. Whilst it remains to be seen how the UK public responds to the Budget changes, we still expect many UK retirees to want the security of a fixed income for their lifetime. The proposed changes to the taxation treatment of pension contracts offer the prospect of meaningful product innovation to better suit the needs of our customers.</p>


<h3 class="title">Treasury and Funding</h3>
<p>The Funding for Lending Scheme and balance sheet reduction being undertaken by some of the major financial institutions has meant that the market for retail deposits has been reasonably soft which has allowed the Bank to improve its overall interest margin.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Whilst downward pressure on retail deposit rates is good generally, it is obviously a concern for savers, whose returns have ebbed away, year after year.</p>

<p class="paragraph">In this respect, I am delighted that we have grown our deposit base by 8.5% this year having attracted many new customers to the Bank as well as retaining the loyalty of existing ones.</p>

<p class="paragraph">I would like to thank those savers, both new and old, who have supported us during the year. We aim to provide all our customers with a bespoke service, specific to their requirements and plan to improve our services in 2015 to make it even easier to do business with us.</p>


<h3 class="title">Our People</h3>
<p>I must pay tribute to our employees, who make the <?php echo quin::$name;?> what it is.</p>

<p class="paragraph">We aim to provide our customers with a professional and personal service, which can only be achieved by staff who are committed to the highest standards of customer service.</p>

<p class="paragraph">In this respect I would like to thank them all for the way they have looked after our customers and contributed to the success of our business.</p>


<h3 class="title">The Outlook</h3>
<p>The fragility or otherwise of the UK's economic recovery can be debated ad infinitum. What is clear is that, across the board, confidence has returned. Employment is at record highs and whilst the productivity conundrum puzzles the economists, the man in the street is more positive.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Our business is heavily influenced by residential and commercial property prices. These have remained buoyant over the year and whilst similar improvement may be too much to ask in 2015, there is no reason to suggest that there will be any material setbacks. Indeed, the changes in stamp duty announced in the Chancellor's Autumn Statement should, if anything, bolster confidence in the residential market.</p>

<p class="paragraph">In summary, I believe that 2015 will provide us with the opportunity to further enhance its reputation and performance in its key markets.</p>
