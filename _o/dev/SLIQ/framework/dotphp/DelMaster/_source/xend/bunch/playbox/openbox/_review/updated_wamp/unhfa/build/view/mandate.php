      <h2><?php echo erko::$acronym;?> Mandate</h2>
      <p>Having determining that the situation faced by South Sudan continues to  constitute a threat to international peace and security in the region and  acting under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, the Security Council by its <a href="#">resolution  1996 (2011)</a> <img src="<?php echo path_to('icon');?>pdf.gif" alt="PDF Document" title="PDF Document" style="border:none;" height="14" width="14"> of 8 July 2011 established the United Nations Mission in the Republic of South  Sudan (<?php echo erko::$acronym;?>) for an initial period of one year as from 9 July 2011 with the  intention to renew for further periods as may be required.</p>

      <p>According to the original mandate <?php echo erko::$acronym;?> was to support the Government in peace consolidation and thereby fostering longer-term state building and economic development; assist the Government in exercising its responsibilities for conflict prevention, mitigation, and resolution and protect civilians; and help the authorities in developing capacity to provide security, establishing the rule of law, and strengthening the security and justice sectors in the country. The initial authorized strength of the Mission stood at up to 7,000 military personnel, including military liaison officers and staff officers, up to 900 civilian police personnel, including as appropriate formed units, and an appropriate civilian component, including technical human rights investigation expertise.</p>

      <p>Following the political and security crisis, which broke out with violence in South Sudan’s capital Juba on 15 December 2013, the Security Council, by its <a href="#">resolution 2132 (2013)</a> of 24 December, approved Secretary-General’s recommendation to temporarily increase the overall troop and police strength of <?php echo erko::$acronym;?>. The interim troop level was raised to 12,500 personnel and the police component to 1,323 personnel, including appropriate formed police units, through temporary transfers from existing peacekeeping operations through inter-mission cooperation. </p>

      <p>In March 2014, the Secretary-General further <a href="#">recommended</a> that the Security Council should keep these increased troops and police levels for at least another 12 months, and temporarily shift Mission’s focus from mainly peacebuilding activities to: protecting civilians; facilitating humanitarian assistance; monitoring and reporting on human rights; preventing further inter-communal violence; and supporting the IGAD process as and when requested, and within available capabilities. The protection priority would be for displaced people sheltering in United Nations compounds and other locations, and would expand once conditions were created for their safe return home, he said, adding that the new posture of <?php echo erko::$acronym;?> would be in place until the two sides to the conflict finalized a political agreement. </p>
   
      <p>By unanimously adopting resolution <a href="#">2155  (2014)</a> of 27 May 2014, the  Security Council decided that <em>Decides</em> that <?php echo erko::$acronym;?> would consist of a  military component of up to 12,500 troops of all ranks and of a police  component, including appropriate Formed Police Units, of up to 1,323 personnel;  and authorized <?php echo erko::$acronym;?> to use all necessary means to perform the  following tasks: </p>
