You should check with your existing provider to see if there are any charges or notice periods should you decide to transfer to us.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Further deposits may be added to an account during its term but only whilst the interest rate payable on the account is the same as the rate on offer for new accounts. No withdrawals are permitted on an account after the initial deposit. You can however invest in as many fixed rate accounts as you like.</p>
