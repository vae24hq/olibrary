<p>
All three institutions were founded by Sir Julian Hodge whose activities since the 1950's are widely acknowledged as having been the catalyst behind the development of the dynamic financial services sector that now exists in South Wales.</p>

<p class="paragraph">We offer a private-bank style relationship to meet the real estate and renewable energy funding needs of our corporate, investor and developer clients.</p>

<p class="paragraph">With a 30 year heritage and decision making close to the ‘front line’ we have the expertise needed to quickly evaluate and respond to your proposal.</p>

<p class="paragraph">One of the few primarily focussed on the real estate sector we typically lend within the £1m - £25m range and provide funding lines across the spectrum of investment property, commercial mortgages and development - as well as for renewable energy projects.</p>

<p class="paragraph">The core focus of <?php echo quin::$name;?> is to be a long-term lending partner. We also provide other ancillary services. As such, we can often complement or replace a client's existing banking arrangements by providing discretely-structured term loans while maintaining the clearing relationship.</p>

<p class="paragraph">We also have an excellent reputation for providing a competitive range of deposit accounts for business and private clients.</p>
