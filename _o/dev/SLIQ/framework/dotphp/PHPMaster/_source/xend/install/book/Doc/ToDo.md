	 - missing file reporting handler

Checker that makes sure every needed library, class, method & function exists on the app.
This will help make sure the app is not tempered
#Later - auto install any missing library after logging that it's missing

Perform this check before calling a class, method or function within the app's project to prevent error resulting from calling an unavailable resource
