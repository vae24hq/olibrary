All three institutions were founded by Sir Julian Hodge whose activities since the 1950's are widely acknowledged as having been the catalyst behind the development of the dynamic financial services sector that now exists in South Wales.</p>

<p class="paragraph">The two earlier financial institutions set up by Sir Julian are now owned by major public companies, but <?php echo quin::$name;?> remains an independent family controlled company and therein lies the key to its culture and philosophy that sets it apart from many other financial institutions.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Prior to its formation, the group which had traded since the 1970's under the Carlyle name had successfully developed a number of financial services companies which have been brought together under the umbrella of <?php echo quin::$name;?>.</p>

<p class="paragraph">The group has, since those early days, pursued a policy of cautious and controlled development, always with a view to the long-term and without the need to adopt short-term strategies often associated with public companies. This approach ensured that the group performed well throughout the recession of the early 1990's and has created a solid platform from which business relationships can be developed within the chosen spheres of operation.</p>

<p class="paragraph">
The core principle of our corporate philosophy is a determination to foster and maintain a personal relationship with customers coupled with a genuine interest in the welfare of all those with whom we have business relationships. The accent is on professionalism allied to a thorough knowledge of the markets in which we operate combined with integrity and efficiency with a capacity for innovation. </p>

<p class="paragraph">Such ideals are not always easy to adhere to in today's complicated world, but only by meeting or, preferably, exceeding customers' expectations can we hope to achieve success. Good communication at a personal level within each business relationship is an essential ingredient.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Apart from its business objectives, the group also recognises a social responsibility to the community and will continue to provide financial support for welfare, medical, academic (<?php echo paragaph_link('jhiam','Julian Hodge Institute of Applied Macroeconomics');?>) and educational concerns. Usually, this is through the medium of The Jane Hodge Foundation or the Sir Julian Hodge Charitable Trust, charities which together own nearly 80% of the ordinary share capital of the parent company, Carlyle Trust Limited.</p>
