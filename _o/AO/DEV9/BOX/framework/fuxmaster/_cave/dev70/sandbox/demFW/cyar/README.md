## Introduction  
CYAR™ framework is an evolving platform for developing modem responsive static or dynamic website, full-featured web applications with database, APIs and other web services using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JS & derived technology.  

### What's the essence?  
Did you see the [characteristics](#characteristics) already? You should.  
Certainly there are many popular frameworks out there, but sometimes you don’t always need a kitchen-sink solution. Yes these frameworks are great but often very bloated and overkill for your project.  

#### Designed to purpose
CYAR™ framework is built for those who need an elegant platform which helps to quickly create simple yet powerful websites, full-featured web applications and APIs using native technology synonym with web development. 




##Characteristics  
I'll let you navigate where you wish to know more.

###CYAR™ is Flexible  

CYAR™ provides very flexible set of codes that lets you do what you need and nothing else.  CYAR™ is awesome for rapid development and prototyping. It is easy to understand as you can learn all about it by just reading its source code!  

###Easy to Build On
CYAR™ framework is easy to build on.  
There’s a default sample website that comes with the setup. The configuration and core library are easily accessible and can be modified or extended to suit your need.  

###Built for Everyone  
CYAR™ makes front-end and back-end web development much faster and easier to maintain.  It is made for everyone (designers, developers and people in between) of all skill levels and projects of any scale.  

###Simple Installation  
> Getting Up & Running is simple  

You can get up and running with CYAR™ taking the following steps.  
- [ ] Download the zip archive  
- [ ] Extract contents to your project directory  
- [ ] Update entries in the configuration file as needed by your project, and  
- [ ] Start building your project.  

###Zero Learning Curve  
> ~~Nope!~~ I'm joking, but it could be.  

Rather than a restrictive coding pattern or language structure, CYAR™ lets you code in native technology such as HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, XML, Javascript, etc.; greatly diminishing the learning curve to between [3 – 0] on a descending scale of 9 to 0 where 0 is no learning curve at all.  

###Small Footprint
CYAR™ is a not bloated, relatively small footprint web framework for developers, designers and everyone in between that helps you quickly write simple yet powerful web applications and APIs  

###Developer’s Edge
With CYAR™, the developer can realize project objective efficiently and swiftly by focusing on building logic without impacting on accustomed or predefined workflow and development scheme.


## History  
History? Not much history really. CYAR™ framework started out as a library built by Deron Ellse to ease personal workflow in web development. The desire for growth, learning new possibilities and approach, following trends while maintaining standard and backward compatibility as much as possible has pushed the constant refining of this framework.  

In the light of open source came the decision to share. I suppose now the history can begin.  




##Getting Started  
####Requirements  
Other than your regular setup, i.e. a web server (Apache or any other HTTP Server), PHP installation and basic modules, optional database server (MySQL, MSSQL, etc.), CYAR™ framework has no special requirements.  

####Prerequisite for Developers  
As a developer you should already have your setup and know your technology for building web applications. Other than this knowledge, nothing is required. However, we can always learn our hand when you need us. 




## Version System  
CYAR™ framework operates a semantic version release system. You can read about [semantic version system](http://semver.org). We basically have major, minor and patch releases.  

### Patch Release  
> Bug fixes and minor fine-tunning  

Patch release are backwards-compatible bug fixes and minor enhancements within the same version number, i.e. 3.2.0, 3.2.1, 3.2.3 etc. You will noticed changes in the right part of the version number.  

###Minor Release  
> Added functionality that won't break your code  

Minor release contains added functionality in a backwards-compatible manner within the same version number. You will noticed changes in the center part of the version number, i.e. 3.2.0, 3.3.0, 3.4.0 etc.  

### Major Release
> Major updates that may break your old code  

Major release are major changes to the program and a change in the left part of the version number, i.e. 3.2.0, 4.3.0, 5.4.0 etc.  


**Please Note:**  
Although we strive to maintain backward compatibility on new version upgrades, it is important that *developers* ("web designers/developers") and users understand that improvement on the program is based on usage, modem requirements, efficiency, relevance and security; as such the direction of the framework will focus more on these factors over backward compatibility.  
We encourage *developers* to stay current and always download the latest version containing fixes and new modules or functionality when necessary, and advise *developers* to avoid overwrite on working editions without having backup.
