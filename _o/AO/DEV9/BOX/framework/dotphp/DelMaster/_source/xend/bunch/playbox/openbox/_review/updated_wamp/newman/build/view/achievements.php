<p class="space-bottom">Newman Construction Co. won the award for its work on State Route 55/U.S. 19 North in Clearwater. There were multiple challenges on this mill and overlay project, including heavy traffic, night work, time restrictions due to commuter traffic, and other ongoing construction projects at either end of this 9-mile stretch of road. With the roadway flanked by numerous businesses, Newman Construction used several flagmen to keep vehicular traffic and pedestrians moving in and out of side streets and parking lots. Despite the difficulties, the company produced a smooth, high-quality road that will benefit area motorists</p>

Watson, State DBE Coordinator with the Florida Department of Transportation for the company’s strong support of Florida’s efforts to utilize DBE’s as subcontractors.</p>
