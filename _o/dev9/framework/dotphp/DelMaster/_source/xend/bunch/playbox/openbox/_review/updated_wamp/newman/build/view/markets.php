<h2 class="sub-heading">Public Works</h2>
<p>Newman Construction has been constructing Public Works projects for 31 years serving federal, state, cities, counties and local municipality clients. With crews experienced in earthwork, drainage, underground utilities (water, sewer, reclaimed water, and underground conduit), roadway bases, paving, sidewalks, etc. Newman can deliver Greenfield projects as well as upgrade/expand existing facilities. Newman also has experience with concrete pavements and concrete slab repair/replacement.</p>

<p class="space-top">Newman also has numerous crews which are highly experienced in structures construction. Our experience has included bridges utilizing concrete beams, steel beams, curved steel girders, steel tubs, concrete tubs, and flat slabs, precast, pre-stressed and post tensioned construction. Our crews also construct both precast and cast-in-place drainage and bridge culverts. These structures have spanned roadways, canals, lakes, and inter-coastal waterways.</p>

<h2 class="sub-heading">Road and Surface Management</h2>
<p>Effective dust control for yards and adjacent industrial roads provides the antidote to unnecessary and costly maintenance, diminished onsite productivity, and complaints from commercial and residential neighbors. Controlling yard dust helps companies meet environmental standards without worrying about compliance-related fines, keeping traffic areas safe, and preventing filters from clogging and damaging equipment.</p>
<p class="space-top">Newman’s tested, proven products and equipment can meet even the toughest demands of yard dust control, as each has been specially developed for maximum environmental safety and superior performance. These products have been extensively tested in the field, in our state-of-the-art laboratory, and by independent organizations such as the U.S. EPA, the California Air Resources Board and Canada’s Environmental Technology Verification Program.</p>

<h4 class="sub-heading">Road and Yard</h4>
<p>Newman’s proven Fines Preservation Program keeps the road in as-built condition and provides the antidote to the dust, potholes, washboarding, and liabilities that result from the stress placed on unpaved roads into and away from oil and gas exploration and production activities. Our binder-enhanced synthetic fluid “keeps the road on the road,” preventing particles (also known as fines) from escaping as fugitive dust. Our program also increases CBR, decreases maintenance frequency, and lowers the life-cycle cost of maintaining unpaved roads.</p>
<ul><em class="sub-title">Benefits</em>
<li>Non-toxic: Will not taint water supply or soil on nearby residents’ properties</li>
<li>Reduces roadway life cycle costs by 50%</li>
<li>Raises CBR for pavement-like strength and a smooth, long-lasting surface</li>
<li>Reduces dust by 80% for up to four years</li>
</ul>


<p class="space-top">Newman’s vast experience as well as our familiarity with standards, specifications and Quality Control / Quality Assurance, makes us the ideal partner for Public Works infrastructure.</p>
